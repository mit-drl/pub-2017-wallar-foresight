\section{Conclusion}

In this work we presented a system for using a quadrotor to examine the blind spots of an autonomous car. We developed a path planning algorithm that maximizes visual coverage of blind spots in a 2D laser scan; created an experimental system using UWBs to localize the quadrotor with respect to the car; and performed tests in a variety of environments to verify the effectiveness of our system. Extensions to our work include planning using 3D laser scan data; improving the accuracy of the UWB localization; and applying our system to other problems such as package delivery and formation control. The authors believe that multi-robot coordination, particularly in the context of an autonomous car and a quadrotor, will become increasingly useful in the future.
