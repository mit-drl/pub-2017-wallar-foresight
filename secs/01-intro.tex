\section{Introduction}

Introduction: Lots of accidents due to not seeing what's going on. For example a pedestrian or a biker behind a car.

This method presents a method augment what a self-driving car can see.
- Occlusions limit the field of view of the car
- A small UAV can fly to explore those blind spots and prevent accidents
- Informative / exploration planning algorithm for the UAV
- Open source communication framework for multi-robot systems
- Experiments with real data captured from our car
