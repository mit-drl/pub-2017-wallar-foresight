Globally, over 3000 people die in vehicle-related accidents and over one hundred thousand are injured or disabled on average \emph{every day} \cite{ASIR2016}.
% Worse still is that this number is continuing to increase \cite{NSC2016Fatality}.
In the United States, over 90\% of these accidents were due to human error \cite{NHTSA_crash_stats}.
This has resulted in the continued development of advanced safety systems by commercial car manufacturers.
%Safety systems in automobiles are undergoing rapid development to address the fact troubling continued increase in traffic injuries and fatalities \cite{NSC2016Fatality}. 
For example, systems exist to automatically brake in the case of unexpected obstacles \cite{Toyota_patent}, maintain a car in a lane at a given speed \cite{bradley2016tesla}, and alert users of pedestrians, signage, and other vehicles on the roadway \cite{Dagan_IVS_2004}. These systems will make our cars safer and eventually autonomous.
However, many accidents are due to blind spots, for example when a vehicle takes a turn with poor visibility or when a pedestrian crosses from behind a parked vehicle. In these accidents, vulnerable road users, i.e. pedestrians and bikers, are typically involved and the consequences are dramatic.

We propose to extend the perception capabilities of a vehicle, autonomous or human-driven, with a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capable of taking off from the car, flying around corners to gather additional data from blind spots and landing back on the car after a mission. Small UAVs are highly mobile and agile and recent developments have made it possible to capture aerial footage autonomously\cite{naegeli17letters}.
The quadcopter could use the car as a charging base,
while the car could send the quadcopter out on missions to scout ahead and
fill in the blind spots in its vision.

A crucial step in enabling a small UAV and an autonomous car to work
together is to ensure that there exists an accurate pose transform between the car
and the quadcopter. The accuracy of GPS is not sufficient when the UAV must navigate
obstacle-filled environments (such as a city center) or land on the car. In this 
paper, we present a method for relative localization using ultra-wideband radios to measure the relative position of the quadcopter relative to the car with an accuracy of <14cm. This information is fused with the internal state estimation to enable the UAV to safely navigate to blind spots and then land back on the car. Furthermore, we have developed a path planning algorithm for remote sensing and have carried out experiments using a quadrotor and a car.

%implemented a Deep Neural Network to detect obstacles, such as pedestrians, from the UAV.


%Introduction: Lots of accidents due to not seeing what's going on. For example a pedestrian or a biker behind a car. Could be similar to the motivation in Wilko's paper.
%
%Autonomous systems are becoming increasingly integrated into
%our daily lives. Two of the most conspicuous examples are UAVs,
%which are used to capture aerial footage, and autonomous cars,
%which promise to make driving much safer and more convenient
%than it is today. Unfortunately, both of these types of autonomous
%robot have deficiencies. UAVs are highly mobile and agile, but they
%have limited range and payload capabilities. Meanwhile, cars and trucks
%have range and payload capabilities several orders of magnitude greater than
%those of UAVs but, being constrained to traveling on roads, are far less mobile.
%
%In the context of autonomous cars, this mobility constraint becomes apparent
%when navigating corners and crowded environments. Since a car cannot
%see around corners and other obstacles without physically reorienting its
%entire bulk, it must often navigate with little information about what obstacles
%it may encounter. Therefore it is blind to obstacles such as a biker or little old
%lady crossing the street behind an oncoming bus and therefore must proceed
%with extreme caution. Pairing an autonomous car with a quadcopter is a potential
%solution to this problem - the quadcopter could use the car as a charging base,
%while the car could send the quadcopter out on missions to scout ahead and
%fill in the blind spots in its vision.
%
%The one crucial step in enabling a quadcopter and an autonomous car to work
%together is to ensure that there exists an accurate transform between the car
%and the quadcopter. GPS, which has an accuracy of about +/- 2m, can suffice
%for when the quadcopter is navigating broad open spaces. However, +/- 2m
%accuracy is completely insufficient for when the quadcopter must navigate
%obstacle-filled environments (such as a city center) or land on the car. In this 
%paper, we present a method using ultra-wideband radios to measure the relative 
%position of the quadcopter relative to the car with +/- 10cm accuracy, enabling 
%the quadcopter to safely navigate to blind spots and then land back on the car.

Ultra-wideband range sensors have in recent years become a popular tool for
localization of quadrotors, particularly in indoor GPS-denied environments, since they can
provide distance measurements with an accuracy of <10cm and a range of
up to 300 m [Decawave].
Indoor localization of quadrotors has been achieved by placing UWB 'anchors'
around the perimeter of a room and attaching a UWB 'tag' on the quadrotor.
Using this technique, \cite{mueller2015fusing} has achieved average localization error of 4-25 cm;
\cite{kempke2016harmonium} an average error of 9 cm; and \cite{benini2013imu}
an average error of 10 cm.
The problem of relative localization - localizing a quadrotor with respect to
a moving target - is more challenging, but in \cite{tobiuwb}, a quadrotor
outfitted with four UWBs was able to follow a person carrying a UWB tag
with <10 cm mean error. Building off of this work, have been able to use
6 UWB sensors on a car to localize a UWB on a quadrotor with an
average mean error of 13.7 cm. Morever, unlike in previous systems,
we take advantage of the accurate relative transform to use the sensors
on the car to plan safe paths for the quadrotor.
