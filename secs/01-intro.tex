\section{Introduction}

Introduction: Lots of accidents due to not seeing what's going on. For example a pedestrian or a biker behind a car. Could be similar to the motivation in Wilko's paper.

This method presents a method augment what a self-driving car can see.
- Occlusions limit the field of view of the car
- A small UAV can fly to explore those blind spots and prevent accidents
- Informative / exploration planning algorithm for the UAV
- Open source communication framework for multi-robot systems
- Experiments with real data captured from our car 

\subsection{Related works}

Motion planning for autonomous cars. Some methods assume full knowledge of the environment [] -> not realistic, while others [] only have local sensing. Our method would work in parallel and provide a "better" map.

Multi-robot mapping -> Vijay Kumar, Scaramuzza and others. Drone + ground robot.

Informative planning and exploration -> V. Kumar, D. Rus, R. Siegwart.

\subsection{Contribution}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Method for informative sensing
\item
Open source communication framework
\end{itemize}

We validate our approach with data collected with our self-driving vehicle and a small UAV.
