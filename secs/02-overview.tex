\subsection{Problem definition}


\subsection{System overview}
A car with XY sensors. A quad with Z sensors...
Image of the car with the quad.

We used a Parrot Bebop 2 as the quadcopter. It is equipped with a camera,
and velocity and altitude measurements can be read from its SDK at a rate of
5 Hz. The Bebop uses a software gimbal to stabilize the camera image.

The inputs to the Bebop are roll angle $\phi$, pitch angle $\theta$, 
yaw rate $\omega$, and z velocity $\dot{z}$. We use
PID controllers to control the inputs.

$$ u = [\phi, \theta, \omega, \dot{z}] $$
