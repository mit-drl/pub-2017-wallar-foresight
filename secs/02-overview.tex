\section{Problem formulation}

We consider a ground vehicle with XY sensors. 
A quad with Z sensors...
Image of the car with the quad.

\begin{problem}
Given the local map as seen by the car, compute a minimal cost path for the drone to explore the unseen areas.
\end{problem}

Our approach consist of ...

We used a Parrot Bebop 2 as the quadcopter. It is equipped with a camera,
and velocity and altitude measurements can be read from its SDK at a rate of
5 Hz. The Bebop uses a software gimbal to stabilize the camera image.

The inputs to the Bebop are roll angle $\phi$, pitch angle $\theta$, 
yaw rate $\omega$, and z velocity $\dot{z}$. We use
PID controllers to control the inputs.

$$ u = [\phi, \theta, \omega, \dot{z}] $$
