abstract ={We consider the problem of navigating a mobile robot through dense human crowds. We begin by exploring a fundamental impediment to classical motion planning algorithms called the âfreezing robot problemâ: once the environment surpasses a certain level of dynamic complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. We argue that this problem can be avoided if the robot anticipates human cooperation, and accordingly we develop interacting Gaussian processes, a prediction density that captures cooperative collision avoidance, and a âmultiple goalâ extension that models the goal-driven nature of human decision making. We validate this model with an empirical study of robot navigation in dense human crowds (488 runs), specifically testing how cooperation models effect navigation performance. The multiple goal interacting Gaussian processes algorithm performs comparably with human teleoperators in crowd densities nearing 0.8 humans/m2, while a state-of-the-art non-cooperative planner exhibits unsafe behavior more than three times as often as the multiple goal extension, and twice as often as the basic interacting Gaussian process approach. Furthermore, a reactive planner based on the widely used dynamic window approach proves insufficient for crowd densities above 0.55 people/m2. We also show that our non-cooperative planner or our reactive planner capture the salient characteristics of nearly any dynamic navigation algorithm. Based on these experimental results and theoretical observations, we conclude that a cooperation model is critical for safe and efficient robot navigation in dense human crowds.},

abstract ={Models capable of capturing and reproducing the variability observed in experimental trials can be valuable for planning and control in the presence of uncertainty. This paper reports on a new data-driven methodology that extends deterministic models to a stochastic regime and offers probabilistic guarantees of model fidelity. From an acceptable deterministic model, a stochastic one is generated, capable of capturing and reproducing uncertain systemâenvironment interactions at given levels of fidelity. The reported approach combines methodological elements from probabilistic model validation and randomized algorithms, to simultaneously quantify the fidelity of a model and tune the distribution of random parameters in the corresponding stochastic extension, in order to reproduce the variability observed experimentally in the physical process of interest. The approach can be applied to an array of physical processes, the models of which may come in different forms, including differential equations; we demonstrate this point by considering examples from the areas of miniature legged robots and aerial vehicles.},

abstract ={This paper presents an adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model (aGMM) formulation for performing multiple-step probabilistic state predictions using a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. The presented prediction algorithm is applicable to any dynamic system that is challenging to model parametrically, but where data is available. Gaussian mixture elements are propagated through the GP by analytically evaluating expectation integrals for the moments of the output distribution. Two metrics are presented and compared for adaptively splitting the initial state distribution into a sum of Gaussians to reduce the effect of nonlinearities on prediction accuracy: (1) an analytical evaluation of the excess kurtosis which measures the non-Gaussianity of the output distribution, and (2) a weighted least-squares regression model which evaluates the local nonlinearity of the GP mapping with respect to the input distribution. In addition, an on-the-fly data selection method is presented to reduce the computational complexity associated with analytically evaluating the higher-order moments of the GP output distribution. The proposed adaptive GP-aGMM formulation is applied to the case of anticipating driver behavior at road intersections using a GP driver behavior model in combination with a parametric vehicle model. Prediction performance for this scenario is evaluated using driving data collected from three human subjects navigating a standard four-way intersection. Results demonstrate that the presented prediction algorithm is capable of accurately capturing multimodal behavior in the GP training data.},

abstract ={
               Modeling and predicting human and vehicle motion is an active research domain. Owing to the difficulty in modeling the various factors that determine motion (e.g. internal state, perception) this is often tackled by applying machine learning techniques to build a statistical model, using as input a collection of trajectories gathered through a sensor (e.g. camera, laser scanner), and then using that model to predict further motion. Unfortunately, most current techniques use offline learning algorithms, meaning that they are not able to learn new motion patterns once the learning stage has finished. In this paper, we present an approach where motion patterns can be learned incrementally, and in parallel with prediction. Our work is based on a novel extension to hidden Markov models, called growing hidden Markov models, which gives us the ability to learn incrementally both the parameters and the structure of the model. The proposed approach has been evaluated using synthetic and real trajectory data. In our experiments our approach consistently learned motion models that were more compact and accurate than those produced by two other state-of-the-art techniques.

abstract ={                 Whenever people move through their environments they do not move randomly.                     Instead, they usually follow specific trajectories or motion patterns                     corresponding to their intentions. Knowledge about such patterns enables a                     mobile robot to robustly keep track of persons in its environment and to improve                     its behavior. In this paper we propose a technique for learning collections of                     trajectories that characterize typical motion patterns of persons. Data recorded                     with laser-range finders are clustered using the expectation maximization                     algorithm. Based on the result of the clustering process, we derive a hidden                     Markov model that is applied to estimate the current and future positions of                     persons based on sensory input. We also describe how to incorporate the                     probabilistic belief about the potential trajectories of persons into the path                     planning process of a mobile robot. We present several experiments carried out                     in different environments with a mobile robot equipped with a laser-range                     scanner and a camera system. The results demonstrate that our approach can                     reliably learn motion patterns of persons, can robustly estimate and predict                     positions of persons, and can be used to improve the navigation behavior of a                     mobile robot.             },

@article{Agha_IJRR_2014,
  Abstract = {In this paper we present feedback-based information roadmap (FIRM), a multi-query approach for planning under uncertainty which is a belief-space variant of probabilistic roadmap methods. The crucial feature of FIRM is that the costs associated with the edges are independent of each other, and in this sense it is the first method that generates a graph in belief space that preserves the optimal substructure property. From a practical point of view, FIRM is a robust and reliable planning framework. It is robust since the solution is a feedback and there is no need for expensive replanning. It is reliable because accurate collision probabilities can be computed along the edges. In addition, FIRM is a scalable framework, where the complexity of planning with FIRM is a constant multiplier of the complexity of planning with PRM. In this paper, FIRM is introduced as an abstract framework. As a concrete instantiation of FIRM, we adopt stationary linear quadratic Gaussian (SLQG) controllers as belief stabilizers and introduce the so-called SLQG-FIRM. In SLQG-FIRM we focus on kinematic systems and then extend to dynamical systems by sampling in the equilibrium space. We investigate the performance of SLQG-FIRM in different scenarios.},

@article{Williams_IJRR_2014,
  Abstract = {We present a parallelized navigation architecture that is capable of running in real-time and incorporating long-term loop closure constraints while producing the optimal Bayesian solution. This architecture splits the inference problem into a low-latency update that incorporates new measurements using just the most recent states (filter), and a high-latency update that is capable of closing long loops and smooths using all past states (smoother). This architecture employs the probabilistic graphical models of factor graphs, which allows the low-latency inference and high-latency inference to be viewed as sub-operations of a single optimization performed within a single graphical model. A specific factorization of the full joint density is employed that allows the different inference operations to be performed asynchronously while still recovering the optimal solution produced by a full batch optimization. Due to the real-time, asynchronous nature of this algorithm, updates to the state estimates from the high-latency smoother will naturally be delayed until the smoother calculations have completed. This architecture has been tested within a simulated aerial environment and on real data collected from an autonomous ground vehicle. In all cases, the concurrent architecture is shown to recover the full batch solution, even while updated state estimates are produced in real-time.},

@article{Latif_IJRR_2013,
  Abstract = {Long-term autonomous mobile robot operation requires considering place recognition decisions with great caution. A single incorrect decision that is not detected and reconsidered can corrupt the environment model that the robot is trying to build and maintain. This work describes a consensus-based approach to robust place recognition over time, that takes into account all the available information to detect and remove past incorrect loop closures. The main novelties of our work are: (1) the ability of realizing that, in light of new evidence, an incorrect past loop closing decision has been made; the incorrect information can be removed thus recovering the correct estimation with a novel algorithm; (2) extending our proposal to incremental operation; and (3) handling multi-session, spatially related or unrelated scenarios in a unified manner. We demonstrate our proposal, the RRR algorithm, on different odometry systems, e.g. visual or laser, using different front-end loop-closing techniques. For our experiments we use the efficient graph optimization framework g2o as back-end. We back our claims up with several experiments carried out on real data, in single and multi-session experiments showing better results than those obtained by state-of-the-art methods, comparisons against whom are also presented.},

abstract ={This paper reports on an exact, real-time solution for serverâclient cooperative localization over a faulty and extremely bandwidth-limited underwater communication channel. Our algorithm, termed the origin state method, enables a âserverâ vehicle to broadcast its navigation information to multiple âclientâ vehicles over a bandwidth-limited and faulty communication channel. The serverâs broadcasted pose-graph can be used in conjunction with an estimator on the client to exactly reproduce the corresponding serverâclient centralized estimate. We present an evaluation over an extensive real-time field implementation of the proposed algorithm for a multi-agent autonomous underwater vehicle network using underwater acoustic modems to communicate in a synchronous-clock transmission framework.},
